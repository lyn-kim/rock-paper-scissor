Rock Paper Scissor game to play against the computer.

My first game built from scratch!

Log of steps taken:
(using only JS - UI will be added during later parts of this curriculum 10/18/21)

1. Linking js file with html document using script tag.
2. Writing a function to choose a random move from an array.
3. Writing a funnction to play one round of game (my input is already
selected and stored in a variable for this step temporarily).
4. Writing a function to play 5 games in a row while logging score.
5. Writing a function to report the winner/loser.
6. Writing a loop to repeat function calls.
7. Revising the single round function to ask for user input using prompt.
Add additional revisions to report computer selection vs player selection
in console before scores.

I went through several days of debugging and through it realized the importance of 
declaring global vs local variables. This project took a lot longer than I anticipated
(and quite frustrating at times) but was also exhilarating. Looking forward to working
on the UI portion of the game soon!
